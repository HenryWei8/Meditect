                Medical Education is still old school. Textbooks, long-breathed articles, scholastic journals,
                and other dry sources are the only way to keep up-to-date with vital, potentially life depending,
                information. In other industries, skills are easy to maintain and develop with technology providing
                so many dynamic and quality resources, however, medicine has yet to reach that point still. Our
                mission is to solve this crisis with content that is accurate, relevant, and fun to learn.

                Game Driven Learning:
            </h3>
            <p class="opacity-70 mb-6 text-lg">
                Learning, especially learning medicine, is an extremely arduous, tedious, and painful journey. Nurses, doctors,
                and other practictioners sacrifice hundreds of thousands of dollars on school along with years of work for
                this effect. However, even after they finish that long process, they are still faced with the fact that
                medicine is growing and changing. By introducing a game-like experience to learning material, we hope
                to alleviate some of this pain by turning a lifelong burden into something much more pleasant and fun.

            <h3 class="font-semibold mb-6 text-4xl">Continuous Learning:</h3>
            <p class="opacity-70 mb-6 text-lg">
                A traditional education is often forgettable or even dreaded. Our system ensures a fully 
                immersive and dynamic interface that constantly challenges medical professionals to be in 
                the moment while learning. It turns books into battles and concepts into experiences.
                By the time you finish, it is our hope that you'll not only know more, but 
                come back hungrier than before.
